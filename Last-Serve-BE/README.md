### Prerequisites for backend

To have a local copy of this lab / assingnment / project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

```

mongodbclient for estasblishing connection and querying mongodb 
express for setting up routes for the rest services
body-parser for parsing json-body and setting json responses
dotenv for fetching and setting environment variables into the nodejs application

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, assume the marker just acquired a computer

```

npm install 
npm start

```

## Deployment

* Checkout the branch main from the repo provided

* From the root of the directory following command can be run to start the application 

```

npm start

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [mongodb documentation ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/node/examples/query-mongodb/) as shown below: 

```

const venusFlytrap = await plants.findOne({ name: "venus flytrap" });


```

The code in [mongodb documentation ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/node/examples/query-mongodb/) as shown below: was implemented by mongodb
[mongodb documentation ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/node/examples/query-mongodb/) Code was used to search for a single document in the mongo db 
[mongodb documentation ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/node/examples/query-mongodb/) Code was modified by searching  the mongodb database with primary key ("_id") rather then other ky pair of the document

      // Return reference to database object
      return client.db('tutorial7');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/quick-start-nodejs-mongodb-how-to-get-connected-to-your-database) as shown below: 

```
async function main(){
    /**
     * Connection URI. Update <username>, <password>, and <your-cluster-url> to reflect your cluster.

        console.error(e);
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
}

main().catch(console.error);

```

The code in [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/quick-start-nodejs-mongodb-how-to-get-connected-to-your-database) was implemented to connect to a MongoDB database using Node.js.
The code is used to connect to a cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
The code was modified to create a singleton pattern to ensure DB object is created only once and by retun a db object connected to the database tutorial7 on the hosted cluster in MongoDB Atlas.

        text: `Your generated key is ${key}. Please use this key to reset your password.`
    };

    const info = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_email.asp) as shown below: 

```

var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'youremail@gmail.com',
    pass: 'yourpassword'
  }
});

var mailOptions = {
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',

};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info){
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
  }
});

```
The code in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_email.asp) was implemented to send an email using Node.js.
The code is used to send a password reset key to the user.
The code was modified by adding a sender's email and the application password generated using the account settings option on GMAIL to the trasporter method. The text field in 'mailOptions' was modified to send a randomly genrated alphanumeric key of size 8 to the user.

    bcrypt.genSalt(10, function (err, salt) {
        bcrypt.hash(request.body.password, salt, async function (err, password_hash) {

        });
    });

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) as shown below: 


```

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const myPlaintextPassword = 's0/\/\P4$$w0rD';

bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
    // Store hash in your password DB.
});

```

The code in [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) was implemented to hash a plaintext message.
The code is used to hash a plaintext password before storing it in the database.
The code was modified by adding a saltRound of 10, hashing the password received in the request body and storing it in a string named 'hashedPassword' to be used later.

  {
    return (true)
  }
    alert("You have entered an invalid email address!")
    return (false)
}

```

The code in [w3resource](lihttps://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.phpnk) was implemented to validate an email using a regular expression.
The code was used to validate the entered email address.
The code was modified by setting the regular expression in a variable 'validEmail' and match it with the state value using the test function.

        <Route path ="posts" element={<Posts />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<h1>Route does not exist</h1>}/>
      </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

```

The code in [dev](https://dev.to/emmanuelthecoder/getting-started-with-react-router-19de) was implemented to route user on different pages.The code was used because same functionality was required in application. The code was modified by replacing application component and route at required places.
